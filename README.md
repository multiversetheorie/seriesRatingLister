<h1>Did you ever ask yourself: 'Is this TV series getting worse?'</h1>
<p>I certainly did. 'seriesRatingLister' a little script I use whenever I sense that I have been through more than one low-quality episode of a certain show.</p>
<p>When you run 'seriesRatingLister', it asks for the name of the series in plain text and an API-key for the <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a> by Brian Fritz.(Unfortunately the IMDb has no official API as of now.) </p>
<p>The result: The season number, episode number and the IMDb rating of every episode in a list. <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx">Get your OMDb API key here</a> and find out where the quality of your favorite show is going!</p>
